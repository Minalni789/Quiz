# Quiz
This is a Python OOP quiz game.
This Python program creates a quiz game using the Question, question_data, and QuizBrain modules. It imports the question data, creates a list of question objects, and uses the QuizBrain module to present the quiz to the user. The program displays each question, accepts user input for the answer, checks if the answer is correct, and provides feedback. Upon completion, it provides the user with a score and a message.
